Sometimes it may be better to wait with creating links until after the new page is created, such as when the new link replaces one to an existing page. In such cases, you can create the link but press Preview instead of Save. In the preview area, clicking on the new page link will start you creating the new page. Later you can go back and add the new link again in the referring page (or if you have the preview still open in another tab, finally pressing Save).
